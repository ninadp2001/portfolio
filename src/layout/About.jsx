        <p>
          I’m a <strong>software engineer</strong> who enjoys working on the{" "}
          <strong>core logic</strong> that makes applications function{" "}
          <strong>reliably and efficiently</strong>. I’m interested in writing{" "}
          <strong>clean, understandable code</strong> and building systems that
          are easy to <strong>maintain, scale, and support</strong> over time. My
          work is driven by <strong>problem-solving</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>thoughtful implementation</strong>, and a focus on{" "}
          <strong>correctness rather than complexity</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work primarily as a <strong>Software Developer</strong>, with hands-on
          experience using <strong>Java, SQL, and REST APIs</strong> to build and
          support application features. I’ve contributed to developing{" "}
          <strong>backend logic</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>database-driven functionality</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong>API-based workflows</strong>, while also assisting with{" "}
          <strong>debugging</strong>, <strong>performance issues</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong>production support</strong> when required.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, I’ve had the opportunity to work across{" "}
          <strong>different environments</strong> — from{" "}
          <strong>small teams</strong> to more{" "}
          <strong>structured systems</strong> — where I handled{" "}
          <strong>software development tasks</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>database operations</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>API integrations</strong>, and{" "}
          <strong>application troubleshooting</strong>. These experiences helped
          me understand how software behaves in{" "}
          <strong>real-world usage</strong>, beyond just development, and
          reinforced the importance of <strong>stability</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>clarity</strong>, and <strong>maintainability</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I’m focused on growing as a{" "}
          <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, strengthening my foundations in{" "}
          <strong>Java and SQL</strong>, and contributing to systems where{" "}
          <strong>reliable software design</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>practical problem-solving</strong> are valued.
